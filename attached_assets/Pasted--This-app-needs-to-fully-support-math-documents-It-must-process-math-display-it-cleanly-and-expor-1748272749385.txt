"This app needs to fully support math documents. It must process math, display it cleanly, and export it properly. Here‚Äôs how to do that ‚Äî step by step, no improvisation."

1. üîê SET UP MATHPIX CREDENTIALS
Go to Replit Secrets tab

Add:

MATHPIX_APP_ID = your MathPix app ID

MATHPIX_APP_KEY = your MathPix key

These are required for all OCR API calls.

2. üì§ SEND DOCUMENTS TO MATHPIX
‚ñ∂Ô∏è For image files:
Send to https://api.mathpix.com/v3/text

Include in the POST:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "src": "BASE64_OR_URL",
  "formats": ["text", "data"],
  "data_options": { "include_latex": true }
}
‚ñ∂Ô∏è For PDF files:
Send to https://api.mathpix.com/v3/pdf (POST)

Wait for pdf_id

Poll https://api.mathpix.com/v3/pdf/{pdf_id} until status = "completed"

‚úÖ Use latex_styled and text fields from the response.

3. üñ•Ô∏è DISPLAY RESULTS IN THE APP
‚úÖ Use MathJax v3 to render math
Accept all standard LaTeX:

Inline: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \)

Block: \[ \int_a^b f(x)\,dx \]

‚úÖ Inject OCR output into DOM
Wrap math segments in span or div with math class

Run MathJax.typesetPromise() after inserting content

Ensure no validation/sanitization blocks rendering

4. üìÑ EXPORT TO PDF (WITH FULL MATH)
DO NOT:
Export raw HTML

Skip MathJax rendering

Cut off after 4 pages

Strip styles

DO:
Wait for MathJax.typesetPromise() to finish

Export the visible DOM, not the unrendered source

Use window.print() or html2pdf.js on the fully rendered .output-container

Apply this in your @media print:
css
Copy
Edit
@media print {
  html, body {
    height: auto !important;
    overflow: visible !important;
    font-family: 'Georgia', serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
    margin: 1in;
  }
  .output-container {
    max-height: none !important;
    overflow: visible !important;
  }
}
üîÅ FINAL INSTRUCTION
"This app must fully support processing, displaying, and exporting math. Math must be extracted from PDF/image, rendered visibly, and exported cleanly. No placeholders. No cutoff. No raw LaTeX. If the math looks right in-app, it must look identical in the PDF. No exceptions.
